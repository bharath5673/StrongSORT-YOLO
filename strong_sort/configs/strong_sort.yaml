  ECC: False             # activate camera motion compensation
  MC_LAMBDA: 0.5         # matching with both appearance (1 - MC_LAMBDA) and motion cost
  EMA_ALPHA: 0.9         # updates  appearance  state in  an exponential moving average manner
  MAX_DIST: 0.2          # The matching threshold. Samples with larger distance are considered an invalid match
  MAX_IOU_DISTANCE: 0.7  # Gating threshold. Associations with cost larger than this value are disregarded.
  MAX_AGE: 60            # Maximum number of missed misses before a track is deleted
  N_INIT: 3              # Number of frames that a track remains in initialization phase
  NN_BUDGET: 20          # Maximum size of the appearance descriptors gallery
